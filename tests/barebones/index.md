# sphinx-basic-ng

A modern skeleton for Sphinx themes.

The template for each section is displayed on this page. To override it, create
your own template in the same location. For example,
`sections/article-main.html` will override the announcement HTML.

Below is a sample Table of Contents.

```{toctree}
:glob:

section-one/index
```

```{toctree}
:glob:
:caption: Caption

section-two/index
```
